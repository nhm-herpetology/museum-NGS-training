>Here we will start building an NGS library of genomic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) for eight samples using starting amounts of 500 ng dsDNA and NEBNext Master Mixes. 

**Materials**

* NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase kit (M0348S/L)
* Serapure magnetic bead solution (from Unit 1)
* NEBNext End Repair Module (E6050)
* NEBNext dA-tailing Module (E6053)  
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* PCR tubes
* Thermal cycler, water bath, or heat block  

1. Set a heat block or water bath to 37 C.
   
2. Using the DNA extractions from Unit 1, we are now going to prepare the DNA for library construction. First, we need to prepare 500 ng from the DNA isolates and then adjust the volumes with water so that all samples have 60 uL for the fragmentation step. I use a spreadsheet with four columns to do this: 
  
Sample ID | Qubit concentration (ng/uL)  | uL needed for 500 ng | uL of water to add
------------ | -------------  | ------------- | -------------
Sample 1 | 10.0 | 50.0  | 10.0
Sample 2 | 18.5  | 27.0 | 33.0
Sample 3 | 33.2  | 15.1 | 44.9
Sample 4 | 80.0  | 6.3  | 53.7

> The third column is the second column value divided by 500 and the fourth column is 60 minus the third column value

3. In 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, prepare the following recipe for all eight samples: 
  * 4 uL Fragmentase Buffer
  * 0.4 uL BSA
  * 2 uL Fragmentase
  * 60 uL extracted DNA

4. Place the 1.5 mL tubes in the 37 C heat block/water bath for 25 minutes. 
  
5. Remove Serapure magnetic bead solution from 4 C storage and agitate/vortex so that beads are suspended in the solution. It should look the same as when we made the beads in Unit 1. 
  
6. Remove the fragmented DNA samples from the 37 C incubation and add 126 uL of Serapure beads to each sample. This is a 1.8X concentration.
