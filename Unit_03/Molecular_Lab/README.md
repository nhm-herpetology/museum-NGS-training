  >In Unit 2 we learned how to construct shotgun genomic libraries for Illumina platforms. The shotgun library is what we will use for the targeted-seqeunce capture of UCEs. 

**Materials**

* Illumina shotgun library
* MyBaits 5k Tetrapod kit
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
* Nuclease-free water
* Magnetic tube rack


**Protocol**
1. Using the shotgun libraries from the last unit...

  <summary>Click to expand protocol!</summary>

  >We will now find out if our UCE capture protocol has been successful using the Agilent TapeStation. 

**Materials**

* 'Super-duper-solid-gold' capture library 
* Agilent TapeStation
* Agilent D1000 Tape cartridge
* Agilent D1000 Sample Buffer
* Agilent D1000 Ladder
* TapeStation vortex (IKA)
* TapeStation loading tubes
* TapeStation pippette tips and pippetter

**Protocol**
>This is taken (more or less) directly from the Agilent TapeStation D1000 [protocol](https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_D1000_QG.pdf)  
  
1. Turn on TapeStation System and connected computer. 

2. Launch the TapeStation Controller Software (icon on desktop)
  
3. Load D1000 ScreenTape into device and loading tips
  
4. Allow reagents (Buffer and Ladder) to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to use. 
  
5. Vortex Buffer and spin down before use. 
  
6. Mix 3 uL Buffer with 1 uL Ladder in a clean TapeStation tube. 
  
7. Mix 3 uL Buffer with 1 uL enriched capture Library
  
8. Spin ladder and sample down in a mini-centrifuge. 
  
9. Vortex using IKA vortexer at 2000 rpm for 1 minute. 
  
10. Again, spin ladder and sample down in a mini-centrifuge.
  
11. Load samples into the TapeStation instrument.
  
12. Select the required samples on the TapeStation Controller. 
  
13. Click 'Start' and specify a filename with which to save results.
