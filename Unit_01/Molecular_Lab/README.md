  >Magnetic Beads are used for extracting genomic DNA, removing small unwanted nucleic acids (e.g. primers, adapaters), and size selection. Modified from B. Faircloth and T. Glenn protocol (UCLA, 2011). Original protocol by Rohland and Reich [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337438/).

**Materials**

* Sera-Mag Speedbeads
* PEG-8000
* 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0
* 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0
* Tween 20
* 5 M NaCl
* Nuclease-free water
* Magnetic tube rack
* One 1.5 mL microcentifuge tube
* Two 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes

**Protocol**
1. In a 50 mL conical (falcon) tube using sterile solutions prepare the TE Buffer 
      * 500 uL 1 M Tris
      * 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA
      * Fill the tube up to the 50 mL line with nuclease-free water
>This will create 50 mL of TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EDTA)

2. Mix Sera-Mag Speedbeads thoroughly and transfer 1 mL to an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 

3. Place the 1.5 mL tube with Speebeads on the magnetic rack until beads are drawn to magnet (~5 minutes)

4. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

5. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

6. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

7. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

8. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

9. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then place in a normal tube rack.
>This will clean and prepare the beads for incorporation into the final solution

10. Add 9 g PEG-8000 to a new, sterile 50 mL conical tube.

11. Add 10 mL 5 M NaCl to the conical tube.

12. Add 500 uL 1 M Tris-HCL to conical tube.

13. Add 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA to conical tube. 

14. Fill the tube up to ~49 mL with nuclease-free water. 

15. Place conical tube on a mixer (or mix by hand) for 3-5 minutes until the PEG-8000 goes into solution. 

16. Add 17.5 uL Tween 20 to conical and gently mix. 
>This will prepare the final solution for the beads.

17. Add the 1 mL Speedbead + TE buffer solution into the 50 mL conical tube. 

18. Fill conical tube up to the 50 mL mark with nuclease-free water (if necessary). Gently mix until entire solution is brown. 
>This is the final bead mixture for DNA extraction, cleaning, and size selection.

19. Wrap the 50 mL conical tube in aluminium foil to protect it from light. Store at 4 C. 

20. Aliquot the mixture into multiple 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for convenient use and contamination avoidance.

## Testing the Magnetic Beads

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand protocol!</summary>

> Before we use any of our precious samples, we want to be confident that the magenetic bead solution works. In this section we will use different amounts of Serapure beads to confirm we can control the size of DNA fragments retained after cleaning. 

**Materials**

* Agarose
* 1X TAE Buffer
* 100% Ethanol
* Nuclease-free water
* Scale
* Microwave
* Electrophoresis rig with power source
* DNA Ladder (for testing beads)
* Gel loading dye  
* Parafilm
* Magnetic rack
* 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
  
**Protocol**
1. Prepare a 1% TAE gel for electrophoresis. At the NHM, we can use a small gel casting frame which will require:
      * 0.75 g Agarose
      * 75 mL 1X TAE Buffer
      * 4 uL of SYBR safe or Gel Red DNA stain

2. Mix the Agarose and TAE Buffer in a glass flask. Microwave the flask until the the Agarose goes into solution (Don't let the flask boil over!)
  
3. Use hot pads to remove the flask from the microwave and allow to cool on the lab bench until you can safely touch the glass. Add the SYBR safe stain to the flask using a pipetter. Mix gently by hand.  

4. Carefully pour the solution into the casting tray and allow to solidify (usually ~20-30 mins)
>This will create the gel needed to test the beads

5. Prepare fresh aliquots of 70% Ethanol. This can be done using the 50 mL conical tubes. Fill the conical up to the 35 mL mark using 100% ethanol. Then fill to the 50 mL mark using sterile nuclease-free water.

6. Mix 3 uL of DNA Ladder with 17 uL of nuclease-free water in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this five times so that you have six tubes with 20 uL of Ladder + water.

7. Add the following amounts of Serapure bead solution to the tubes:
    * Tube 1 - 60 uL (3.0X)
    * Tube 2 - 50 uL (2.5X)
    * Tube 3 - 40 uL (2.0X)
    * Tube 4 - 30 uL (1.5X)
    * Tube 5 - 20 uL (1.0X)
    * Tube 6 - 10 uL (0.5X)
  
>Follow the protocol below for each of the seven tubes. This can be done at the same time using a magnet rack that fits multiple tubes. 

8. After adding the Serapure beads incubate at room temperature for 5 mins.

9. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)

10. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter.

11. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 1)

12. Remove supernatent as in Step 10.

13. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 2)
  
14. Remove supernatent as in Step 10.
  
15. Allow beads to sit until there is no residual ethanol on the sides of the tube. This usually takes about 2-3 mins. 

16. Add 20 uL nuclease-free water to dried beads and resuspend the beads in solution by removing the tube from the magnet rack. This may require gently flicking the tube to get the beads back into solution. You may then need to centrifuge the tube to return the beads to the solution to the bottom of the tube. 

17. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)
>The DNA in the ladder has now been through the entire cleaning process.  
  
18. Once the beads have migrated to the magnet and the solution is clear, remove 5 uL of solution and mix with 2 uL of Gel Loading Dye on a piece of Parafilm.

19. Load the 7 uL of Serapure-processed DNA Ladder + loading dye into your gel (which should now be placed in the Electrophoresis Rig) and run using the Power Source.   
  
>If the bead solution is effective we should see that we small ladder fragments (<150 bp), were lost when using dilute concentrations of beads (e.g. 0.5X), but retained when using higher concentrations of beads (e.g. 3.0X).
