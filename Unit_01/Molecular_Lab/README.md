  >Magnetic Beads are valuable for extracting genomic DNA, removing small unwanted nucleic acids (e.g. primers, adapaters), and size selection. Modified from B. Faircloth and T. Glenn protocol (UCLA, 2011). Original protocol by Rohland and Reich [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337438/).

**Materials**

* Sera-Mag Speedbeads
* PEG-8000
* 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0
* 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0
* Tween 20
* 5 M NaCl
* Nuclease-free water
* Magnetic tube rack
* One 1.5 mL microcentifuge tube
* Two 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes

**Protocol**
1. In a 50 mL conical (falcon) tube using sterile solutions prepare the TE Buffer 
      * 500 uL 1 M Tris
      * 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA
      * Fill the tube up to the 50 mL line with nuclease-free water
>This will create 50 mL of TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EDTA)

2. Mix Sera-Mag Speedbeads thoroughly and transfer 1 mL to an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 

3. Place the 1.5 mL tube with Speebeads on the magnetic rack until beads are drawn to magnet (~5 minutes)

4. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

5. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

6. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

7. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

8. Remove supernatent with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatent with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

9. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then place in a normal tube rack.
>This will clean and prepare the beads for incorporation into the final solution

10. Add 9 g PEG-8000 to a new, sterile 50 mL conical tube.

11. Add 10 mL 5 M NaCl to the conical tube.

12. Add 500 uL 1 M Tris-HCL to conical tube.

13. Add 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA to conical tube. 

14. Fill the tube up to ~49 mL with nuclease-free water. 

15. Place conical tube on a mixer (or mix by hand) for 3-5 minutes until the PEG-8000 goes into solution. 

16. Add 17.5 uL Tween 20 to conical and gently mix. 
>This will prepare the final solution for the beads.

17. Add the 1 mL Speedbead + TE buffer solution into the 50 mL conical tube. 

18. Fill conical tube up to the 50 mL mark with nuclease-free water (if necessary). Gently mix until entire solution is brown. 
>This is the final bead mixture for DNA extraction, cleaning, and size selection.

19. Wrap the 50 mL conical tube in aluminium foil to protect it from light. Store at 4 C. 

20. Aliquot the mixture into multiple 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for convenient use and contamination avoidance.

> Before we use any of our precious samples, we want to be confident that the magenetic bead solution works. In this section of the lab we will explore how to test the bead mixture you made at the start of the lab. 

**Materials**

* Agarose
* 1X TAE Buffer
* 100% Ethanol
* Nuclease-free water
* Scale
* Microwave
* DNA Ladder (for testing beads)
* Magnetic rack
  
**Protocol**
1. First, prepare a 1% TAE gel for electrophoresis.
