  >Magnetic Beads are used for extracting genomic DNA, removing small unwanted nucleic acids (e.g. primers, adapaters), and size selection. Modified from B. Faircloth and T. Glenn protocol (UCLA, 2011). Original protocol by Rohland and Reich [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337438/).

**Materials**

* Sera-Mag Speedbeads
* PEG-8000
* 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0
* 1.0 M Tris, pH 8.0
* Tween 20
* 5.0 M NaCl
* Nuclease-free water
* Magnetic tube rack
* One 1.5 mL microcentifuge tube
* Two 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes

**Protocol**
1. In a 50 mL conical (falcon) tube using sterile solutions prepare the TE Buffer 
      * 500 uL 1 M Tris
      * 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA
      * Fill the tube up to the 50 mL line with nuclease-free water
>This will create 50 mL of TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EDTA)

2. Mix Sera-Mag Speedbeads thoroughly and transfer 1 mL to an empty 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 

3. Place the 1.5 mL tube with Speebeads on the magnetic rack until beads are drawn to magnet (~5 minutes)

4. Remove supernatant with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatant with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

5. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

6. Remove supernatant with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatant with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

7. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then return to the magenet rack. Allow beads to be drawn to magnent (~5 minutes).

8. Remove supernatant with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatant with a P100 or P200 pipetter. 

9. Add 1 mL of TE Buffer to the beads, remove from magnet, vortex (mix), and then place in a normal tube rack.
>This will clean and prepare the beads for incorporation into the final solution

10. Add 9 g PEG-8000 to a new, sterile 50 mL conical tube.

11. Add 10 mL 5 M NaCl to the conical tube.

12. Add 500 uL 1 M Tris-HCL to conical tube.

13. Add 100 uL 0.5 M EDTA to conical tube. 

14. Fill the tube up to ~49 mL with nuclease-free water. 

15. Place conical tube on a mixer (or mix by hand) for 3-5 minutes until the PEG-8000 goes into solution. 

16. Add 17.5 uL Tween 20 to conical and gently mix. 
>This will prepare the final solution for the beads.

17. Add the 1 mL Speedbead + TE buffer solution into the 50 mL conical tube. 

18. Fill conical tube up to the 50 mL mark with nuclease-free water (if necessary). Gently mix until entire solution is brown. 
>This is the final bead mixture for DNA extraction, cleaning, and size selection.

19. Wrap the 50 mL conical tube in aluminium foil to protect it from light. Store at 4 C. 

20. Aliquot the mixture into multiple 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for convenient use and contamination avoidance.

## Testing the Magnetic Beads

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand protocol!</summary>

> Before we use any of our precious samples, we want to be confident that the magenetic bead solution works. In this section we will use different amounts of Serapure beads to confirm we can control the size of DNA fragments retained after cleaning. 

**Materials**

* Agarose
* 1X TAE Buffer
* 100% Ethanol
* Nuclease-free water
* Scale
* Microwave
* Electrophoresis rig with power source
* DNA Ladder (for testing beads)
* Gel loading dye  
* Parafilm
* Magnetic rack
* 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
  
**Protocol**
1. Prepare a 1% TAE gel for electrophoresis. At the NHM, we can use a small gel casting frame which will require:
      * 0.75 g Agarose
      * 75 mL 1X TAE Buffer
      * 4 uL of SYBR safe or Gel Red DNA stain

2. Mix the Agarose and TAE Buffer in a glass flask. Microwave the flask until the the Agarose goes into solution (Don't let the flask boil over!)
  
3. Use hot pads to remove the flask from the microwave and allow to cool on the lab bench until you can safely touch the glass. Add the SYBR safe stain to the flask using a pipetter. Mix gently by hand.  

4. Carefully pour the solution into the casting tray and allow to solidify (usually ~20-30 mins)
>This will create the gel needed to test the beads

5. Prepare fresh aliquots of 70% Ethanol. This can be done using the 50 mL conical tubes. Fill the conical up to the 35 mL mark using 100% ethanol. Then fill to the 50 mL mark using sterile nuclease-free water.

6. Mix 3 uL of DNA Ladder with 17 uL of nuclease-free water in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this five times so that you have six tubes with 20 uL of Ladder + water.

7. Add the following amounts of Serapure bead solution to the tubes:
    * Tube 1 - 60 uL (3.0X)
    * Tube 2 - 50 uL (2.5X)
    * Tube 3 - 40 uL (2.0X)
    * Tube 4 - 30 uL (1.5X)
    * Tube 5 - 20 uL (1.0X)
    * Tube 6 - 10 uL (0.5X)
  
>Follow the protocol below for each of the seven tubes. This can be done at the same time using a magnet rack that fits multiple tubes. 

8. After adding the Serapure beads incubate at room temperature for 5 mins.

9. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)

10. Remove supernatant with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatant with a P100 or P200 pipetter.

11. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 1)

12. Remove supernatant as in Step 10.

13. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 2)
  
14. Remove supernatant as in Step 10.
  
15. Allow beads to sit until there is no residual ethanol on the sides of the tube. This usually takes about 2-3 mins. 

16. Add 20 uL nuclease-free water to dried beads and resuspend the beads in solution by removing the tube from the magnet rack. This may require gently flicking the tube to get the beads back into solution. You may then need to centrifuge the tube to return the beads to the solution to the bottom of the tube. 

17. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)
>The DNA in the ladder has now been through the entire cleaning process.  
  
18. Once the beads have migrated to the magnet and the solution is clear, remove 5 uL of solution and mix with 2 uL of Gel Loading Dye on a piece of Parafilm.

19. Load the 7 uL of Serapure-processed DNA Ladder + loading dye into your gel (which should now be placed in the Electrophoresis Rig) and run using the Power Source.   
  
>If the bead solution is effective we should see that small ladder fragments (<150 bp), were lost when using dilute concentrations of beads (e.g. 0.5X), but retained when using higher concentrations of beads (e.g. 3.0X).

* Magnetic rack
* 50 mL conical (falcon) tubes
* 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
  
**Protocol**
1. Prepare Lysis Buffer for tissue digestion in a new, sterile 50 mL conical (falcon) tube.
  
2. Add 1 mL of 5.0 M NaCL to the empty conical tube.

3. Add 5 mL of 1.0 M Tris to the conical tube. 

4. Add 2.5 mL of 0.5 M EDTA to the conical tube.
  
5. Add 1.25 mL of 20% SDS to the conical tube.
  
6. Using sterile, nuclease-free water fill the conical tube up to the 50 mL line. 
>This will make a Lysis Buffer with the following concentrations: 100 mM NaCL, 100 mM Tris, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS. 
  
7. Place ~3 mg of tissue in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 100 uL Lysis Buffer and 5 uL of Proteinase K.
  
8. Incubate at 55 C for a few hours (or overnight if necessary). During the digestion phase, occasionally remove the 1.5 mL tube and vortex to agitate the dissolving tissue. Once the tissue is digested into solution, move onto Step 9. 
>At this point the cells have been lysed and the DNA is in solution with other macromolecules

9. Remove sample from incubator and allow to reach room temperature.   
  
10. Add 180 uL of Serapure bead solution to the digested tissue. Make sure the Serapure beads are resuspended and the solution is dark brown before adding it to the sample.
  
11. After adding the Serapure beads incubate at room temperature for 5 mins.

12. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)

13. Remove supernatant with a P1000 pipetter and discard. Remove any remaining supernatant with a P100 or P200 pipetter.

14. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 1)

15. Remove supernatant as in Step 13.

16. Add 500 uL of 70% ethanol and let stand for 1 min (Wash No. 2)
  
17. Remove supernatant as in Step 13.
  
18. Allow beads to sit until there is no residual ethanol on the sides of the tube. This usually takes about 2-3 mins.
  
19. While waiting for the final bead drying, let's make a solution 10 mM Tris (this will be used substantially to elute DNA throughout the course). In a 50 mL conical (falcon) tube mix the following:
  * 500 uL 1M TRIS
  * 49.5 mL nuclease-free water
>This is your DNA storage buffer
  
20. Add 200 uL 10 mM Tris to dried beads and resuspend the beads in solution by removing the tube from the magnet rack. This may require gently flicking the tube to get the beads back into solution. You may then need to centrifuge the tube to return the beads to the solution to the bottom of the tube. 

21. Place 1.5 mL tube on magnet rack. Allow beads to seperate (~5 min)
>The purified DNA is now in the supernatant.
  
22. Remove 200 uL extracted DNA and place in a new, sterile 1.5 mL microcentifuge tube.

## Quantification of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)  

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand protocol!</summary>

>Here we will quantify DNA extracts using a fluorometer. This is important because only double-stranded DNAs will be used in the NGS library preparations. 

**Materials**
  
* Extracted DNA from five samples  
* Qubit HS dsDNA reagent kit
  * HS Buffer
  * Fluorecent Dye
  * Size Standard 1
  * Size Standard 2
* Qubit fluorometer
* Crystal-clear Axygen microcentrifuge tubes

**Protocol**  
>This protocol is written for use with 1 uL of DNA extract. For samples that are likely to have very little dsDNA, it can be modified so that more template is used. 

1. First we need to make a Master Mix from the Qubit reagents. For each sample (+ the two size standards) we need to combine 1 uL of Dye with 199 uL of buffer. 
>In our case this means we add 7 uL of dye with 1393 uL of buffer

2. Add 190 uL of Master Mix to two Axygen tubes (these will be used for the Size Standard DNA).

3. Add 10 uL of Size Standard 1 to the first Axygen tube.
  
4. Add 10 uL of Size Standard 2 to the second Axygen tube. 
  
5. Add 199 uL of Master Mix to five Axygen tubes (these will be used for the sample DNA).
  
6. To each of the five sample tubes, add 1 uL of your DNA extract from each sample. 
>At this point, you should have seven tubes, each with 200 uL of liquid in them (two size standards and five samples). 

7. Vortex each of the tubes and then spin down using a lab bench mini-centrifuge. Allow to sit at room temperature for 5 mins. 
  
8. Turn on the Qubit fluorometer. Select the appropriate assay kit from the home menu. 
  
9. Follow the instructions for inserting the size standards. 
  
10. Once calibrated, conduct a reading on each of the DNA extract samples and note the concentrations (in ng/uL) 
>Note: In order to get the concentrations in ng/uL format, you may need to modify the units on the Qubit fluorometer. 
  
11. These concentrations will be used to determine how many uL of DNA extract we use for the start of our library preparation protocol in the next Molecular Laboratory [Unit 2](https://github.com/nhm-herpetology/museum-NGS-training/tree/main/Unit_02/Molecular_Lab). 

12. Discard the used Axygen tubes at the end of the laboratory session.
