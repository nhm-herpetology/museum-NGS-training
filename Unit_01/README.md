# Unit 1: Introduction to short read sequencing and library preparation
**Summary**

In this unit participants will learn:

* The basics of short read sequencing (Lecture)
* To construct NGS shotgun libraries (Molecular Laboratory)
* To prepare raw Illumina data for downstream analyses (Computer Laboratory)
