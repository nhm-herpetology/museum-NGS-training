  >Magnetic Beads are valuable for extracting genomic DNA, removing small unwanted nucleic acids (e.g. primers, adapaters), and size selection. Modified from B. Faircloth and T. Glenn protocol (UCLA, 2011). Original protocol by Rohland and Reich [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337438/).

**Materials**

* T4 DNA Ligase
* Adapter Oligonuclotides
* NEB Phusion polymerase
* Illumina TruSeq primers
* Nuclease-free water
* Magnetic tube rack

  >We will now find out if each of the enrichment on each of our ten sample pools was successful using the Agilent TapeStation. 

**Materials**

* PCR-enriched RADseq libraries
* Agilent TapeStation
* Agilent D1000 Tape cartridge
* Agilent D1000 Sample Buffer
* Agilent D1000 Ladder
* TapeStation vortex (IKA)
* TapeStation loading tubes
* TapeStation pippette tips and pippetter

**Protocol**
>This is taken (more or less) directly from the Agilent TapeStation D1000 [protocol](https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/ScreenTape_D1000_QG.pdf)  
  
1. Turn on TapeStation System and connected computer. 

2. Launch the TapeStation Controller Software (icon on desktop)
  
3. Load D1000 ScreenTape into device and loading tips
  
4. Allow reagents (Buffer and Ladder) to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to use. 
  
5. Vortex Buffer and spin down before use. 
  
6. Mix 3 uL Buffer with 1 uL Ladder in a clean TapeStation tube. 
  
7. Mix 3 uL Buffer with 1 uL enriched capture Library
  
8. Spin ladder and sample down in a mini-centrifuge. 
  
9. Vortex using IKA vortexer at 2000 rpm for 1 minute. 
  
10. Again, spin ladder and sample down in a mini-centrifuge.
  
11. Load samples into the TapeStation instrument.
  
12. Select the required samples on the TapeStation Controller. 
  
13. Click 'Start' and specify a filename with which to save results. 
  
14. If there is evidence that all of the sub-libraries have worked, proceed to step 15. 
  
15. We will now pool the sub-libraries to make your final ddRADseq libray for sequencing.
